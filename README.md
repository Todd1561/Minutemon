This program is used to alert of status changes under Linux of your MinuteMan UPS, originally built for the Entrust ETR-500, but should work with most MinuteMan USB-based UPS.  Run minutemon without any command line arguments to get a print out of the help and syntax.  Email is sent using sendmail which will need to be configured on your system.  The following information will be reported when there's a status change:

* UPS is on mains?
* Battery needs replacement?
* Battery is discharging?
* Battery is charging?
* UPS below capacity limits?
* Internal failure?
* Shutdown imminent?
* Battery fully discharged?
* Battery fully charged?
* Battery charge percentage.
